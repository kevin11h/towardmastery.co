<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.</p>

<p>I liked pretending to build advanced technologies out of wood sticks and crayons. Children like to babble about their future job titles, though mine never changed since I was ten years-old. At the time, my teacher asked the class to write down some ideas about who we had like to be when we grow up. I vividly remember coming up with two items, one of them being “architect”, yet only writing down the latter : “scientist engineer”. My adult self still wonders what “scientist engineer” actually even mean, although it was, at the time, the closest I could find to an inventor career.</p>

<p>At thirteen years old, I stumbled upon some tutorials on “Le Site du Zéro” (now OpenClassrooms.com) concerning software development. That’s when I wrote my first Hello World program. I instantly fell in love with this idea of making stuff out of apparently nothing, much like drawing on a white canvas. I later did a bit of web development, but nothing extraordinary - mainly colorful HTML blocks with some text. Still, my dream job went from “scientist engineer” to computer engineer. After graduating from high school, I entered INSA Lyon, a french engineering school. Two bumpy years passed, and I joined INSA Lyon’s telecommunications department.</p>

<p>My time spent as an engineering student allowed me to experiment career-wise. I worked as an humanitarian webmaster for two months in an association. Next, I endorsed the role of an IT manager in a student NGO for two years. I finished my degree inside a consulting company as a software engineer intern for six months.<br>
My interest for building useful things triggered my desire to become an engineer. The opportunities offered to me lead me to be an entrepreneur.<br>
Right before the start of my end-of-study internship, Pierre-Alexis, an engineering friend of mine, proposed me to come aboard a startup project as a web developer. I quickly agreed to meet the team, and this side hustle project ended up becoming Justinien four months down the road.<br>
On the fifth month, the company was officially established. I was in the middle of an interview process at a consulting firm in Paris, revolving around a well paid and interesting data science job, when I decided to put a stop to it. I realized that I wanted to dedicate myself fully to the entrepreneurship career, that it was meant for me.<br>
I finished my internship two months later. It’s been one month since I am a full-time tech co-founder.</p>

<p>Starting a company, let alone at a young age and fresh out of college, is often considered as a bold and risky move. I think it is not, or at least that it does not have to be. I rationalized my fear of starting in a simple manner.</p>

<p>On one hand, the notion of a “most appropriate time to start” is more flexible than you think. In my case, Justinien is a legal technology startup, so I had no need for either a big network or a lot of money to start. Heck, you don’t even need a perfect-thought-out idea to begin with. You can figure out the exact opportunity later. All you need is to start making : get the right issue to tackle, the right people to work with - maybe none - and the right mindset to begin with. Not so easy, yet achievable. The moment I choose to go full-time is when I believed I acquired all three - and I still do.</p>

<p>I believe my startup solves the right challenge, considering it solves an important issue, in a unique way, while creating value out of it.<br>
I believe I have the right partners, being able to execute our common vision in a synchronised fashion without rejecting our individual aspirations.<br>
I believe I have the right mindset : full confidence. I am confident I can learn anything I want. I am fearless I can execute at will without the need for external motivation. I am convinced going all-out will ensure the success of this adventure.<br>
There is the fear of starting, and there is the fear of finishing. I have neither of them.</p>

<p>What is the worst case scenario anyways. Having to find a job ? Running out of money ? Moving out with my parents ? Not so bad.<br>
I am positive I can find a job anytime I want considering the skills entrepreneurship is teaching me. I solve problems. I became a proactive and independent craftsman. I know how to add value to the tiniest detail. What kind of business would not want this kind of worker ? Surely not one you want to work for.</p>

<p>I would give the same advice Bukowski once wrote to aspiring writers.<br>
Don’t do it for fame. Don’t do it to get someone in your bed. Or to get rich. Don’t even think about it as a way to be free, owing to the fact that you will trade a form of slavery for another. Don’t choose it.<br>
Do it because it’s bursting out of your very soul, and you have no other choice but to give in to it.</p>
